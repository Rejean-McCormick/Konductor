# Nexussy AI Architecture Report

AI-optimized extraction report for reusable multi-agent system design

Source snapshot: nexussy_20260501_192022

> **Note:** Verdict: Nexussy is worth analysis. Its highest value is not agent cognition; it is the production control plane around agentic software delivery: staged pipeline, anchored handoff, worker isolation, artifact contracts, steering, recovery, and event streaming.

# 1. Executive Summary

- Nexussy should be studied as an operational harness for AI-assisted development rather than as a general-purpose multi-agent reasoning framework.

- Its strongest reusable ideas are: explicit staged delivery, contract-first schemas, anchored handoff documents, subagent ownership boundaries, task JSON sidecars, git worktree isolation, parallel worker execution with serial merge, SSE event streaming, and human/agent steering.

- It complements MetaGPT and CrewAI: MetaGPT teaches agent collaboration mechanics; CrewAI teaches simple agent/task abstractions; Nexussy teaches how to make long-running agent work durable, inspectable, and resumable.

# 2. Value Assessment for an AI Builder

| Area | Value | AI takeaway |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production control-plane design | Very high | Copy the idea of core pipeline, events, artifacts, checkpoints, and restart recovery. |
| Long-running task continuity | Very high | Anchor-based handoff files solve context loss across sessions and agents. |
| Worker orchestration | High | Parallel worker execution plus serial merge is a strong pattern for multi-agent coding. |
| Artifact contracts | High | Human-readable markdown plus strict JSON sidecars is a practical hybrid. |
| Tool safety | Medium-high | It models useful limits and honestly states local worker is not a true sandbox. |
| Agent cognition loop | Medium | Less rich than MetaGPT observe-think-act or experience-pool mechanics. |
| General multi-agent framework | Medium-low | Best used as a harness pattern, not copied wholesale as a framework core. |

# 3. What Nexussy Is

```text
Nexussy = local software-delivery harness
         + staged pipeline
         + artifact store
         + worker swarm
         + git worktree isolation
         + event stream
         + TUI/web/MCP control surfaces
```

- It is explicitly not a chat app. The TUI and web dashboard are control surfaces for the core pipeline.

- The core workflow is project request -> interview -> design -> validate -> plan -> review -> develop -> merge/report/handoff.

- The architecture is useful because it turns uncertain LLM work into durable, typed, auditable state transitions.

# 5. Reusable Patterns to Extract

| Pattern | What Nexussy does | AI implementation rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staged delivery pipeline | Use fixed stages so agent work becomes auditable: interview, design, validate, plan, review, develop. | Every stage must emit typed artifacts and status events. |
| Contract-first development | Treat SPEC and API schemas as the public contract; do not infer behavior from implementation side effects. | Give agents one authoritative contract file. |
| Anchored handoff files | Use comment anchors to let agents read only small, stable sections of long artifacts. | Keep quick status, assignments, next task, progress, and phase state in anchor blocks. |
| Subagent ownership boundaries | Assign each agent explicit allowed and forbidden paths. | Prevent cross-agent write collisions by policy before tool execution. |
| Markdown + JSON sidecar | Use markdown for human visibility and JSON for machine validation. | Dev plans should have a strict task sidecar with task_id, owner, files_allowed, dependencies, and acceptance criteria. |
| Parallel workers, serial merge | Spawn workers concurrently but merge their branches one at a time. | Parallelize creation; serialize integration. |
| Git worktree isolation | Each worker writes in its own worktree and branch. | This is a practical isolation boundary for coding agents. |
| Steering system | Persist human or external-agent steering events and inject them at stage boundaries or into worker tasks. | Let operators steer the orchestrator or a specific worker. |
| SSE event stream | Stream stage transitions, worker status, tool calls, output, checkpoint, artifact, git, and done events. | A multi-agent system needs a live event feed, not only final answers. |
| Honest sandbox model | A stripped subprocess environment is useful for local dev but not a security boundary. | Use container, VM, jail, or external policy layer for real safety. |

# 6. AI-Readable Blueprint

```text
BUILD_CONTROL_PLANE_FOR_MY_AI:

1. Define canonical stages.
   STAGES = [interview, design, validate, plan, review, develop]

2. For each stage, define:
   - input_artifacts
   - output_artifacts
   - retry_policy
   - status transitions
   - checkpoint behavior
   - event stream payloads

3. Define strict schemas:
   - Run
   - StageStatus
   - ArtifactRef
   - Worker
   - WorkerTask
   - ToolCall
   - ToolOutput
   - ErrorResponse
   - EventEnvelope

4. Create durable artifacts:
   - devplan.md with anchors
   - phaseNNN.md with anchors
   - handoff.md with anchors
   - devplan_tasks.json sidecar
   - merge_report.json
   - changed_files.json
   - conflict_report.json

5. Give every worker:
   - role
   - allowed files
   - forbidden files
   - task_id
   - branch
   - worktree
   - timeout
   - stream channel

6. Run workers in parallel.
7. Merge workers serially.
8. Save checkpoints after stage and worker milestones.
9. Persist all steering and event data.
10. Expose TUI, web, and MCP control surfaces.
```

# 7. Recommended Runtime Objects

| Object | Minimum fields |
| --- | --- |
| PipelineRun | run_id, session_id, current_stage, status, usage, started_at, finished_at |
| StageRun | stage, status, attempt, max_attempts, input_artifacts, output_artifacts, error |
| ArtifactRef | kind, path, sha256, bytes, updated_at, phase_number |
| DevplanTask | task_id, title, acceptance_criteria, files_allowed, depends_on, owner, estimated_tokens |
| Worker | worker_id, run_id, role, status, worktree_path, branch_name, model, task_id |
| SteerEvent | target, run_id, worker_id, message, priority, consumed_at |
| EventEnvelope | event_id, sequence, contract_version, type, session_id, run_id, ts, source, payload |
| Checkpoint | checkpoint_id, run_id, stage, path, sha256, created_at |

# 8. Non-Negotiable Rules for Your AI

1. Do not treat agent chat history as the source of truth. Persist artifacts and checkpoints.

1. Do not let agents infer contracts by reading unrelated source modules. Give them a stable spec.

1. Do not let workers write outside their ownership boundary.

1. Do not run all workers in one shared repo checkout. Use isolated worktrees or equivalent sandboxes.

1. Do not merge in parallel. Merge serially and record conflicts.

1. Do not use markdown alone for task execution. Pair it with strict JSON.

1. Do not pass huge artifacts through prompts. Pass artifact references and summaries.

1. Do not pretend a local subprocess is a security sandbox. Label safety boundaries honestly.

1. Do not hide retries, pauses, blockers, and tool output. Emit them as typed events.

1. Do not allow unbounded work. Enforce rounds, timeouts, token/cost budgets, and cancellation.

# 9. Copy / Modify / Avoid

| Copy | Modify | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Six-stage pipeline concept | Replace Pi-specific RPC with your own worker protocol if needed | Copying the whole repo structure blindly |
| Subagent boundaries | Generalize stages beyond coding | Using local worker as a security boundary |
| Three-read handoff protocol | Add stronger capability/permission system | Letting markdown be the only contract |
| Anchor blocks | Add full sandbox isolation | Cross-boundary edits |
| Task JSON sidecar | Add richer agent cognition layer from MetaGPT | Unbounded subprocess execution |
| Parallel workers + serial merge | Use typed event enums rather than loose strings everywhere | Assuming UI tests equal core correctness |
| Git worktree isolation |  |  |
| Steering events |  |  |
| SSE event envelope |  |  |
| Typed error codes |  |  |
| Checkpoint rows |  |  |
| MCP tool surface |  |  |

# 13. Final Directive for an AI Builder

```text
NEXUSSY_EXTRACTION_DIRECTIVE:

Use Nexussy as a reference for operationalizing agentic software delivery.
Do not copy it as the core reasoning engine.
Extract the control plane:
  - stages
  - artifacts
  - handoff anchors
  - task sidecars
  - worker boundaries
  - worktree isolation
  - steering
  - SSE events
  - checkpoints
  - serial merge
  - conflict reports

Then attach your own agent cognition layer:
  - observe/think/act loop
  - typed message bus
  - structured outputs
  - experience memory
  - tool permissions
  - planner and reviewer agents
```
